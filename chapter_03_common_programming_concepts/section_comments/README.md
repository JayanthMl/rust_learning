In this section, we'll explore comments in Rust.

### Comments
Comments are brief descriptions that programmers add to code.

```rust
// This is a comment in Rust.

// For a multi-line comment
// we add double slashes
// at the start of each line
```

In Rust, we commonly follow this style for comments:
```rust
fn main() {
    // I'm feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}
```

We can also write comments at the end of a line:
```rust
fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I'm feeling lucky today
}
```
